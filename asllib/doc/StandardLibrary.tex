\chapter{Standard Library\label{chap:StandardLibrary}}

In addition to the operations, ASL provides some standard subprograms.
The standard subprograms are available from the following address:
\url{https://github.com/herd/herdtools7/blob/\VERSION/asllib/libdir/stdlib.asl}
\identi{KBLH}
The standard subprograms given there provide one way of implementing them.
ASL implementations can implement the subprograms in any way that provides equivalent behavior.

Note that \verb|print(...)| and \verb|println(...)| are \printstatementsterm{},
and \verb|Unreachable()| is an \unreachablestatementterm{}.
They are not standard subprograms.
