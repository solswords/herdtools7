\chapter{Disclaimer}

This document is part of the ASLRef material, maintained in the
\href{https://github.com/herd/herdtools7}{herdtools7 GitHub repository}.

This material covers ASLv1, a new, experimental, and as yet unreleased version of ASL.
In addition to the release of this document, Arm actively contributes to
\url{https://github.com/herd/herdtools7}.

This material is work in progress, more precisely at Alpha quality as
per Arm’s quality standards. In particular, this means that it would be
premature to base any production tool development on this material.
A list of open items being worked on can be found in \appendixref{UnimplementedInASLRef}
and \appendixref{MissingTransliteration}.

We welcome feedback, questions, and feature requests — please contact us by writing
